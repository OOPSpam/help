[Make](https://www.make.com/en?utm_source=oopspam&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=oopspam-partner-program) (similar to Zapier) is a visual automation platform that lets you send information between OOPSpam API and thousands of apps with just a few clicks. All you have to do is drop [OOPSpam Make App](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/oopspam-anti-spam) to your scenario and enter API key.

Let's look at the following example.

!["Contact Form 7 integrates with OOPSpam Anti-Spam on Make"](OOPSpamApp-Integromat.png)

On this scenario, we add and connect Contact Form 7, OOPSpam Anti-Spam and Airtable apps.

1. Contact Form 7 app receives form submissions and passes data to OOPSpam app.
2. OOPSpam analyzes and passes the spam score to the filter between OOPSpam and Airtable app.
3. Filter allows data to be passed to Airtable app only if the spam score is less than 3.
4. Airtable receives data and insert it to a spreadsheet.
5. âœ… Done!

Every contact form, comment, email and chat apps on Make can be connect in similar fashion.

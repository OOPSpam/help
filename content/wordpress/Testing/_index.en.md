| Good day, My name is Eric and unlike a lot of emails you might get, I wanted to instead provide you with a word of encouragement – Congratulations\r\n\r\nWhat for?  \r\n\r\nPart of my job is to check out websites and the work you’ve done with pos-cash.de definitely stands out. \r\n\r\nIt’s clear you took building a website seriously and made a real investment of time and resources into making it top quality.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a catch… more accurately, a question…\r\n\r\nSo when someone like me happens to find your site – maybe at the top of the search results (nice job BTW) or just through a random link, how do you know? 	| testing@example.com, test@test.com 	|

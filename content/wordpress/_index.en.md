### Introduction

[The OOPSpam plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) integrates with the OOPSpam API to protect your website's comment system, registration, and major contact form builders from spam.

{{< notice note >}}
  When someone fills out and submits your contact or comment form, the OOPSpam plugin checks the submission for spam. This is done by analyzing the IP address, email address, and message content of the submission. If the plugin detects any characteristics commonly associated with spam, it will mark the submission as spam and prevent it from reaching you. This helps to protect your website and keep your inbox free of unwanted messages.

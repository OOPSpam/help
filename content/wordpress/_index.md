## Introduction

[The OOPSpam plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/) integrates with the [the OOPSpam API](https://www.oopspam.com) to protect your website's comment system, registration, and major contact form builders from spam.

## How OOPSpam Protects Your Website

When a visitor submits your contact or comment form, the OOPSpam plugin instantly springs into action:

1. **Submission Analysis**: The plugin uses three key elements:
   - IP address
   - Email address
   - Message content

2. **Spam Detection**: Using advanced algorithms, OOPSpam checks for patterns and characteristics typically associated with spam.

3. **Instant Decision**: If spam is detected, the plugin immediately:
   - Marks the submission as spam
   - Blocks it from reaching your inbox

4. **Protection**: This process effectively:
   - Shields your website from potential threats
   - Keeps your inbox clean and manageable

By automating spam detection, OOPSpam allows you to focus on genuine messages and maintain a secure online presence.

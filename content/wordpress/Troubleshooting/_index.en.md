### I'm a paid customer but I see warning about API limit

If you're experiencing an API limit warning on your WordPress dashboard, please follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Confirm that you have a valid API key. Make sure that you have registered on the OOPSpam Dashboard and copied the key.
2. Paste the API key into _My API Key_ in the OOPSpam WordPress Settings.
3. Select _OOPSpam Dashboard_ from _I got my API Key from_
4. Check _Activate Spam Protection_ for the contact form plugin you have.
5. Wait for the first form or comment submission to come in.
6. The API usage numbers will be updated with each submission and the warning will be removed.

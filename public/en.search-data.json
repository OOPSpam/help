"},"title":"WordPress"},"/wordpress/configuration/":{"data":{"":"","#":"Quick set up The OOPSpam WordPress plugin requires minimal configuration to function properly. Once the initial setup is complete, all management can be handled through the WordPress dashboard.\nTo get started quickly, follow these steps:\nRegister on the OOPSpam Dashboard and copy the API key. Paste the key into the ‚ÄúMy API Key‚Äù field in the OOPSpam WordPress Settings. Select ‚ÄúOOPSpam Dashboard‚Äù from the ‚ÄúI got my API Key from‚Äù setting. Ensure that the ‚ÄúActivate Spam Protection‚Äù option is checked for the contact form plugin you are using. Spam protection for comments is enabled by default. ‚ÑπÔ∏è The Sensitivity Level setting in the OOPSpam plugin controls how aggressively the plugin checks submissions for spam. The default setting is 3, which is a balance between catching spam and avoiding false positives (legitimate submissions marked as spam). We recommend using the ‚ÄòModeration‚Äô option for the Sensitivity Level setting. This balanced option typically provides the best combination of spam detection accuracy and minimal false positives for most users.. However, if you believe that the default setting is not a good fit for your website, please reach out to our support team for assistance. Contact form specific settings When a supported contact form builder is installed, the OOPSpam WordPress plugin will automatically detect it and display relevant settings. For example, if the plugin detects that you have installed the Elementor Page Builder, it will display specific settings for Elementor Forms.\nWe see three settings here:\nActivate Spam Protection Elementor Form Spam Message The main content field ID (optional) Let‚Äôs look at each setting in details.\nActivate Spam Protection: Enables spam filtering for this specific contact form plugin.\nElementor Form Spam Message: Displays an error message when spam is detected. This can happen when legitimate users are unable to submit the form. You can use this setting to provide a custom message to guide them to an alternative way to contact you, such as through email. It also allows you to hide your actual email address and only display it to legitimate visitors.\nThe main content field ID (optional): The OOPSpam plugin detects spam not only based on IP and email, but also by analyzing the message content submitted through forms. By default, the plugin only captures the content of the first message field. If your form includes multiple message fields (textarea fields), the plugin will only analyze the first one. However, using this setting, you can specify which textarea field the OOPSpam plugin should analyze for spam.\nTo do so, you need to enter Field ID. It‚Äôs under Advanced tab of a textarea field in your Elementor Forms.\nSimilar to Elementor Forms, all contact form plugins have a Field ID that can be copied and pasted into this setting field, allowing the OOPSpam plugin to identify which field‚Äôs content should be analyzed for spam.\nPrevent form submissions by country and language The OOPSpam WordPress plugin offers two methods to prevent unwanted submissions, by filtering based on the country of origin and the language of the message.\nAllow messages only from these countries: This setting allows you to specify which countries you want to allow submissions from. By adding countries here, you can quickly limit submissions to only those countries, while still keeping your website accessible worldwide.\nBlock messages from these countries: This setting allows you to specify which countries you want to block submissions from.\nAllow messages only in these languages: If your contact form includes a message field, you can use this filter to only allow submissions written in specific languages. This is another way to limit the submissions you receive through your contact form.\nManually block email, IP, keyword The plugin automatically spam checks every form submission, registration, comment with the OOPSpam API. But sometimes you may want to quickly block email, IP address or a keyword in the message. To block manually you can use the Manual Moderation tab in the plugin settings.\nAdd the email, IP address or keyword to the appropriate field in the `Manual Moderation‚Äô tab. Add one item per line.\nPrivacy settings We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible privacy options. To effectively detect spam, OOPSpam only needs a minimal amount of data. When a user submits a comment or contact form, the plugin collects the user‚Äôs IP address, email, and message content. It then sends this information to the OOPSpam API for spam detection.\n‚ö†Ô∏è The OOPSpam plugin does not store any personal data that is submitted through the APIs. All data is stored in your local WordPress database.\nIf you encounter any false positive or false negatives, you have the option to submit them to us for review. This allows the system to improve itself based on your report and the data will be deleted within a week.\nHere we have three settings:\nDo not analyze IP addresses: When this setting is enabled, the plugin will not send the IP address of a submission to our servers for spam detection.\nDo not analyze Email addresses: When this setting is enabled, the plugin will not send the email address of a submission to our servers for spam detection.\nRemove sensitive information from messages: When this setting is enabled, the plugin will attempt to detect and remove any personal information such as email addresses, street addresses, phone numbers, and first and last names from the message. It is important to note, however, that there is no guarantee that all personal information will be accurately removed.\nAdditional settings There are additional settings that you may find useful:\nMove spam comments to: By default, the OOPSpam plugin will move a spam comment to the Spam folder in Comments. You can change this setting to move it to the Trash folder instead. Consider short messages as spam: Many spam messages are too short to be a meaningful sentence. This setting allows you to catch this type of spam. The OOPSpam WordPress plugin also includes two additional menus: Form Spam Entries and Form Ham Entries. These menus allow you to view and manage the submissions that the plugin has identified as spam or legitimate messages (ham).\nEmpty ‚ÄúForm Spam Entries‚Äù table every: Allows you to set an interval for automatically removing all entries in the Form Spam Entries table. This table holds all the spam submissions to your website. The default interval is set to one month. Empty ‚ÄúForm Ham Entries‚Äù table every: Allows you to set an interval for automatically removing all entries in the Form Ham Entries table. This table holds all the legitimate submissions (non-spam) to your website. The default interval is set to one month. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Check Logs to learn more about these tables. "},"title":"Configuration"},"/wordpress/form-entries/":{"data":{"":"","logs-in-the-oopspam-dashboard#Logs in the OOPSpam Dashboard":"Logs in the WordPress Dashboard When you enable spam protection for your contact forms, every submission will be stored in one of two places: the Form Ham Entries or the Form Spam Entries.\nThe Form Ham Entries table stores all submissions that were not detected as spam. The Form Spam Entries table stores all submissions that were detected as spam. You can use these tables to review and report any misdetected entries to us, which will help OOPSpam improve its spam detection capabilities and better meet the specific needs of your website.\nTo report a falsely flagged entry to OOPSpam:\nGo to the Form Spam Entries or Form Ham Entries table in the OOPSpam plugin settings in your WordPress dashboard. Hover over the entry you want to report. Click on the ‚ÄúNot Spam‚Äù link for a submission that was incorrectly marked as spam, or the ‚ÄúSpam‚Äù link for a submission that was incorrectly marked as legitimate. The page will refresh, and the status of the entry will update to ‚ÄúReported as not spam‚Äù or ‚ÄúReported as spam‚Äù. By default, both the Form Ham Entries and Form Spam Entries tables will be emptied automatically once every month. This helps keep the size of the tables manageable and does not affect the performance of the OOPSpam plugin or the accuracy of the spam detection.\nYou can change the interval at which the tables are cleared by using the Empty ‚ÄúForm Spam Entries‚Äù table every and Empty ‚ÄúForm Ham Entries‚Äù table every settings in the OOPSpam plugin settings in your WordPress dashboard.\nLogs in the OOPSpam Dashboard You can also view these reported entries on the OOPSpam Dashboard under the ‚ÄúReported‚Äù section. This allows you to easily track and review all reported entries, and help OOPSpam improve its spam detection algorithms.\nEntries that are reported and reviewed in the OOPSpam Dashboard will be removed within a week once they are resolved.","logs-in-the-wordpress-dashboard#Logs in the WordPress Dashboard":""},"title":"Logs"},"/wordpress/hooks/":{"data":{"":"The plugins comes with two hooks:\nHook Purpose oopspam_check_for_spam Overwrite spam filtering.
